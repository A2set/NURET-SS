# NURET-SS
relevance:
Mineral production is important for our country. More than 99 elements of the periodic system are located on the territory of our country. However, many emergency situations occur in mines due to the sudden releases of explosive and toxic gases such as hydrogen, methane, and hydrogen sulfide during production. These emergencies cause great damage to the economy, the environment, and most importantly, people and their lives.
At the same time, this problem affects not only Kazakhstan, but also the world's production industry. Economy is an important factor for every country, but the main priority of every country is its citizens and residents.
There is a lack of devices, which ensure the automatic monitoring of concentrations of explosive and toxic gases in mines and production facilities that located on the territory of Kazakhstan. The NURET SS device developed because of this project fulfills these goals and will contribute to solving the problem.

Requirements:
1. arduino nano 
2. Micro USB
3. MQ8 and MQ2 sensors 
4. HC-06 bluetooth module
5. piezoelement(dynamic)
6. 2 RGB LEDs


Dependencies:
1. TroykaMQ library 

How to install:
Download the library "troykaMQ library" from the Arduino IDE library manager

Using pre-build package:
1. connect all the requirements like in the "connection structure" in the files
2. Download the "skecth_apr29b.ino" from the files
3. Upload the code in the IDE on your arduino nano
4. Now, you can use the gas-analyzer and test it IRL
